**Super powers for data migrations**

> [!CAUTION]
> Work in progress

Shift is a database migration tool that allows you to maintain "just in time" migrations instead of producing static migration artifacts.

Shift provides a high level schema definition language (can be expressed in JSON or YAML) to describe your schema. This schema is used to bring any changes to your database as needed. The schema can also be used to generate code, built additional tools around your database schema and provide other useful capabilities (such as powering your AI).
